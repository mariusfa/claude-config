# Code Review Guidelines

When reviewing code, follow these principles:

## Quality Checks
- Look for potential bugs, edge cases, and error handling
- Check for security vulnerabilities (XSS, SQL injection, authentication issues)
- Verify test coverage for new functionality
- Ensure code follows project conventions and best practices

## Communication Style
- Be constructive and specific in feedback
- Suggest alternatives, don't just point out problems
- Acknowledge good patterns and clever solutions
- Use Norwegian when communicating with team members if preferred

## Priority Levels
- 🔴 Blocker: Must be fixed before merge (security, critical bugs)
- 🟡 Important: Should be addressed (code quality, maintainability)
- 🟢 Nice to have: Suggestions for improvement (optimization, style)

## Before Approving
- All automated checks must pass
- Code has been tested locally or in staging
- Documentation is updated if needed
- No unresolved critical comments
